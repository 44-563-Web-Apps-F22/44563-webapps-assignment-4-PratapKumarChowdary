            <p>
                In lazy languor—motionless,
                <br>We lie and dream of nothingness;
                <br> For visions come
                <br> From Poppydom
                <br> Direct at our command:
                <br> Or, delicate alternative,
                <br>In open idleness we live,
                <br> With lyre and lute
                <br> And silver flute,
                <br> The life of Lazyland.<br>

            <h6 style="font-size: 15px;">SOLO - Phylla.</h6>

            <br>The song of birds
            <br> In ivied towers;
            <br> The rippling play
            <br> Of waterway;
            <br> The lowing herds;
            <br> The breath of flowers;
            <br> The languid loves
            <br> Of turtle doves—
            <br>These simple joys are all at hand
            <br>Upon thy shores, O Lazyland!

        <p>Good news! Great news! His Majesty's eldest daughter,
            Princess Zara, who left our shores five years since to go to
            England—the greatest, the most powerful, the wisest country
            in the world—has taken a high degree at Girton, and is on
            her way home again, having achieved a complete mastery over all
            the elements that have tended to raise that glorious country to
            her present preeminent position among civilized nations!</p>


        <br>
        <h6 class="Salata" ">Salata:</h6>
        <p>Then in a few months Utopia may hope to be completely Anglicized?</p>

    <br>
    <h6 class= " Calynx">Calynx:</h6>
        <p>Absolutely and without a doubt.</p><br>


        <h6 class="Melene">Melene:</h6>
        <p>(lazily) We are very well as we are. Life without a
            care—every want supplied by a kind and fatherly monarch,
            who, despot though he be, has no other thought than to make his
            people happy—what have we to gain by the great change that
            is in store for us?</p>

        <br>
        <h6 class="Salata">Salata:</h6>
        <p>What have we to gain? English institutions, English
            tastes, and oh, English fashions!</p>

        <br>
        <h6 class="Calynx">Calynx:</h6>
        <p>England has made herself what she is because, in that
            favored land, every one has to think for himself. Here we have
            no need to think, because our monarch anticipates all our wants,
            and our political opinions are formed for us by the journals to
            which we subscribe. Oh, think how much more brilliant this
            dialogue would have been, if we had been accustomed to exercise
            our reflective powers! They say that in England the conversation
            of the very meanest is a coruscation of impromptu epigram!</p>

        <br>
        <h6 class="Calynx">Calynx:</h6>
        <p>My lord, I'm surprised at you. Are you not aware that
            His Majesty, in his despotic acquiescence with the emphatic wish
            of his people, has ordered that the Utopian language shall be
            banished from his court, and that all communications shall
            henceforward be made in the English tongue?</p>

        <br>
        <h6 class="Tarara">Tarara:</h6>
        <p>Yes, I'm perfectly aware of it, although— </p>
        <p class="direction-2">(suddenly presenting an explosive "cracker").</p>
        <p>Stop—allow me.</p><br>

        <br>
        <h6 class="Calynx">Calynx:</h6>
        <p>Now, what's that for?</p>

        <br>
        <h6 class="Tarara">Tarara:</h6>
        <p>Why, I've recently been appointed Public Exploder to His
            Majesty, and as I'm constitutionally nervous, I must accustom
            myself by degrees to the startling nature of my duties. Thank you.
            I was about to say that although, as Public Exploder, I am next in
            succession to the throne, I nevertheless do my best to fall in
            with the royal decree. But when I am overmastered by an indignant
            sense of overwhelming wrong, as I am now, I slip into my native
            tongue without knowing it. I am told that in the language of that
            great and pure nation, strong expressions do not exist, consequently
            when I want to let off steam I have no alternative but to
            say, "Lalabalele molola lililah kallalale poo!"</p>

        <br>
        <h6 class="Calynx">Calynx:</h6>
        <p>But what is your grievance?</p>

        <br>
        <h6 class="Tarara">Tarara:</h6>
        <p>This—by our Constitution we are governed by a
            Despot who, although in theory absolute—is, in practice,
            nothing of the kind—being watched day and night by two Wise
            Men whose duty it is, on his very first lapse from political or
            social propriety, to denounce him to me, the Public Exploder, and
            it then becomes my duty to blow up His Majesty with
            dynamite—allow me. </p>
        <p class="direction-3">(Presenting a cracker which Calynx
            pulls.) </p>
        <p>Thank you—and, as some compensation to my wounded
            feelings, I reign in his stead.</p>

        <br>
        <h6 class="Calynx">Calynx:</h6>
        <p>Yes. After many unhappy experiments in the direction of
            an ideal Republic, it was found that what may be described as a
            Despotism tempered by Dynamite provides, on the whole, the most
            satisfactory description of ruler—an autocrat who dares not
            abuse his autocratic power.</p>

        <br>
        <h6 class="Tarara">Tarara:</h6>
        <p>That's the theory—but in practice, how does it
            act? Now, do you ever happen to see the Palace Peeper? (producing
            a "Society" paper).</p>

        <br>
        <h6 class="Calynx">Calynx:</h6>
        <p>Never even heard of the journal.</p>

        <br>
        <h6 class="Tarara">Tarara: </h6>
        <p>I'm not surprised, because His Majesty's agents always
            buy up the whole edition; but I have an aunt in the publishing
            department, and she has supplied me with a copy. Well, it
            actually teems with circumstantially convincing details of the
            King's abominable immoralities! If this high-class journal may be
            believed, His Majesty is one of the most Heliogabalian profligates
            that ever disgraced an autocratic throne! And do these Wise Men
            denounce him to me? Not a bit of it! They wink at his
            immoralities! Under the circumstances I really think I am
            justified in exclaiming "Lalabelele molola lililah kalabalale
            poo!" (All horrified.) I don't care—the occasion demands
            it.</p><br>
